/*
	what does this command do?
	this command is responsible for accessing the trigger file and creating a new release branch in 2 repos,
	the trigger file within the "eks-a-releaser" branch is accessed and its release: contents are extracted
	next, a new branch is created using the extracted release value within the eks-a and build-tooling repo

	Release Process Timeline :
	(1) User first updates trigger file contents within "eks-a-releaser" branch
	(2) User commits changes and raises a PR to be merged into "main" branch
	(3) Codebuild/Pipeline will be triggered once this specific PR is created
	(4) This command will be the first one to be executed and the new release branch will be created
	Moving forward from this point on, all further changes will continue to be committed into the "eks-a-releaser" branch but raised PR's will now target the newly created branch

	MISSING : include code to create same branch also in build-tooling repo
